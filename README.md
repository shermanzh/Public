Hi! This is my repository of assignments and projects that I've worked on during my studies as a computer science student. Please keep in mind that this repository is not in it's final state. Thanks for viewing!

## ArrayBoundedList.java & BoundedList.java
The code defines a BoundedList<E> interface, which is implemented into the ArrayBoundedList<E> class. This setup provides a data structure that stores a fixed number of elements in an array, and offers several functionalities for managing and interacting with lists of elements.

## TimeSpan.java
The class models a duration in hours and minutes, encapsulated as total minutes, and offers utility methods for creating, adding, and comparing time spans. It checks for legal values and provides methods for conversion of total minutes into hours and minutes, while supporting equality checks and string representation of TimeSpan objects.

## FoDS Final Analysis.ipynb
A Python data analytics report that analyzes a dataset concerning American car thefts in 2015. The report utilizes Python's data analyzing tool, pandas, to manipulate data into smaller, readable tables for the purpose of singling out desired information. It also permits data editing for compatibility, which was needed in order to convert number strings into usable numbers.
